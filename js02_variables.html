            //VARIABLES
            //in programming, variables are used to store information
            //a variable is a named location in memory that holds data
            //when naming a variable, there are a few rules:
            //  1. variables names must consist of ONLY letter, numbers and underscores
            //  2. variables MUST start with a letter (preferably lowercase)
            //  3. should be mnemonic (describe what they hold)
            //  4. should be camelCased for readability
                
                
            //DECLARING a variable means giving it a name
            //in Javascript all variables are declared with keyword let
            let firstName;
            let age;
            let gpa;
            let isMale;
            //you may see other code that uses var instead of let
            //var and let have different scopes for their variables

                
            //INITIALIZING a variables means we assign a starting value
            //variables are assigned with =
            firstName="Sanaan"; //this is a String(several keystrokes) and must be in double quotes
            age=45; //integer - integers do not use quotes
            gpa=3.9; //decimal - decimal numbers (floating point) do not use quotes
            isMale = true;  //boolean  - true or false - no quotes
                
            //it is possible to both DECLARE and INITIALZE in the same step
            let middleInit = 'G';  //this is a character variable, a single keystroke, and uses single quotes
            
                
            //CONCATENATION
            //add two strings together to make one
            //it uses the + operater
            let str1="Hello.";
            let str2="Good to see you!";
            document.getElementById('seeme').innerHTML = str1+" "+str2;
                

            let num1=15;
            let num2=21;
            document.getElementById('seeme').innerHTML += "The sum of " +num1+ " and "+num2+" is "+(num1+num2);
            //parenthesis are needed in the above example because the + operator serves as addition AND concatenation
            //without the parenthesis, the concatenation will happen from right to left resulting in 1521
            //the parenthesis override the order of operations and force the addition to happen first
