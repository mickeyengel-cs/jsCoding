            //On the first iteration x is 1, then it becomes 2 and so on.  When it becomes 11, the loop
            //condition fails, the loop breaks and the rest of the code continues on.

            //Note: it is allowed to write loops inside of loops, conditions inside of loops, and
            //loops inside of conditions.

                VARIABLE UPDATES: There are a variety of update commands that can be used -
                x = x+1, x+=1, x++ -> increases the value of x by 1
            
                You can also use -=, *=, /=
