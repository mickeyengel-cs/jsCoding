            //The relation should always be written in parenthesis and the if line doesn't get a semicolon
            //Following the condition, use a set of { } to denote the conditional code

                    You are older than 10 years old
                    You are not first in the alphabet
                These pieces of code execute because their conditions evaluate to true.
                The password code does NOT execute because the password variable is not equal to letmein

                Experiment with the code by changing the variable values and see what the output is.

            //fails.  NOTE: an else statement does NOT get its own condition, it is based off the relation
            //associated with the if.
